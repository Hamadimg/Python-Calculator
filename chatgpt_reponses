Basic Tkinter TK Items

Label: It is used to display text or image on the screen.

label = tk.Label(root, text="This is a label")

Button: It is used to add buttons in your application.
button = tk.Button(root, text="This is a button", command=your_function)

Entry: It provides input fields to the user.
entry = tk.Entry(root)


Canvas: It is used to draw shapes in your application like lines, circle etc.
canvas = tk.Canvas(root, width=100, height=100)
canvas.create_line(0, 0, 100, 100)

Check Button: They are used to select multiple options by the user.
check_button = tk.Checkbutton(root, text="Check this box", variable=var)

Radio Button: These buttons are used to select one option from multiple choices.
radio_button = tk.Radiobutton(root, text='Option1', value=1)


Menu Button: It is a part of top-down menu that stays on the window all the time.
menu_button = tk.Menubutton(root, text="Menu")

Scale: This widget provides a slider to the user.
scale = tk.Scale(root)

Text: Text widget is used to display multi-line text or to accept multiline text as input from the user.
text = tk.Text(root)


Ways to Place Objects in Tkinter

Pack: This geometry manager organizes widgets in blocks before placing them in the parent widget.

widget.pack()


Grid: It organizes widgets in a table-like structure in the parent widget.
widget.grid(row=row_num, column=column_num)

Place: This geometry manager organizes widgets by placing them in a specific position in the parent widget.
widget.place(x=x_position, y=y_position)



In Tkinter, making elements responsive or scale according to window size is achieved by setting the sticky parameter and using a weight attribute on the grid system. Sticky parameter can be set to directions 'n', 's', 'e' and 'w'.

Here's an example of usage:
import tkinter as tk

root = tk.Tk()
frame = tk.Frame(root)
frame.pack(fill=tk.BOTH, expand=1)

button = tk.Button(frame, text="This is a button")
button.grid(row=0, column=0, sticky="nsew")

frame.rowconfigure(0, weight=1)
frame.columnconfigure(0, weight=1)

root.mainloop()
